For Python coding, creating projects, debugging, and adding features,
I\'d rank these models:

**1. Claude Sonnet 4.5** - Best overall for coding. It offers excellent
code quality, strong reasoning for debugging, and efficient
problem-solving for feature additions.

**2. GPT-5** - Very capable for complex coding tasks with strong
reasoning abilities.

**3. Gemini 3 Pro** - Powerful for complex coding projects, though still
in preview.

**4. Claude Sonnet 4** - Slightly behind 4.5 but still excellent for
coding tasks. (1x in copilot cli)

**5. GPT-4.1** - Solid coding performance with good versatility.

**6. GPT-5.1** - Similar to GPT-4.1, still in preview.

**7. Gemini 2.5 Pro** - Good for complex tasks but may be overkill for
standard coding.

**8. Claude Haiku 4.5** - Fast and efficient for simpler coding tasks,
but less capable for complex debugging or architecture decisions. (.33x
in copilot cli)

**9. GPT-4o** - Decent but older generation.

**10. Grok Code Fast 1** - Optimized for speed over depth, better for
quick snippets.

**11. GPT-5 mini** - Cost-efficient but limited for complex projects.

For most Python development work, **Claude Sonnet 4.5** or **GPT-5**
would be your best choices, offering the right balance of code quality,
debugging insight, and architectural thinking.
