Recommendations
Given your RTX 3060 (12GB VRAM) and needs:

1. Keep using qwen2.5:14b - It's clearly working well for you and runs efficiently at 14B
parameters

2, Use codestral:22b when accuracy matters more than speed - For complex refactoring or
critical code

3, Consider trying these alternatives if you want to experiment:

* deepseek-coder-v2:1 6b - You already have it! It's generally well-regarded and
might outperform qwen2.5-coder

* codegemma:7b - Smaller, faster, Google's code model

* starcoder2:15b - Strong code understanding
