The Fix:
You need to explicitly use Python 3.11's pip:

cmd

cd D:\Misc\Python311
python.exe -m pip install chardet

Or the full path version:

cmd

D:\Misc\Python311\python.exe -m pip install chardet

This will ensure chardet gets installed into the correct Python 3.11 environment that your
NSSM service is actually using.
